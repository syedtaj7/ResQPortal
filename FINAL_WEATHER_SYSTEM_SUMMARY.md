## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### 📊 **Advanced Data Processing**
```javascript
// Real-time weather warning validation
const getComprehensiveWeatherWarning = (disaster) => {
  // Extract actual weather values
  const weatherData = extractWeatherValues(details);
  const forecastData = extractForecastData(disaster.details);
  
  // Only show warnings when conditions actually exist
  let hasRealWarnings = false;
  
  // Data-driven warning analysis
  if (weatherData.rainfall > 75) {
    primaryWarning = "🚨 FLASH FLOOD EMERGENCY";
    hasRealWarnings = true;
  }
  
  // Return honest status
  return {
    title: primaryWarning,
    warnings: activeWarnings,
    forecast: forecastData,
    hasRealWarnings: hasRealWarnings,
    description: hasRealWarnings ? 
      `${activeWarnings.length} active warning(s)` : 
      "Live monitoring - No active warnings"
  };
};
```

### 🎯 **Error Resolution**
- **Fixed constant assignment error** by changing `const activeWarnings` to `let activeWarnings`
- **Proper variable scoping** for dynamic warning arrays
