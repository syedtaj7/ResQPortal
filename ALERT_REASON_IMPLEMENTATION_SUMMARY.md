### **Alert Reason Function**
```javascript

  const details = disaster.details?.toLowerCase() || '';
  const title = disaster.title?.toLowerCase() || '';
  
  // Weather-related reasons with specific measurements
  if (details.includes('flash flood')) {
    return 'Flash Flood Emergency';
  }
  if (details.includes('heavy rain')) {
    const rainfallMatch = details.match(/rainfall:\s*(\d+\.?\d*)\s*mm\/h/i);
    if (rainfallMatch) {
      return `Heavy Rainfall - ${rainfallMatch[1]}mm/h`;
    }
    return 'Heavy Rainfall Alert';
  }
  // ... more specific reason extraction
};
```

### **Alert Reason Display**
```javascript
{/* Alert Reason - Bold and Prominent for Critical Disasters */}
{disaster.severity === 'high' && (
