### 🔄 **Fallback Handling**
- **"Weather Warning - General Alert"** for unspecified weather warnings
- **Ensures consistency** even when specific patterns aren't detected

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### 📊 Smart Analysis Function
```javascript
const getSpecificWeatherWarning = (disaster) => {
  if (disaster.type !== "Weather Warning") return disaster.type;
  
  const details = disaster.details.toLowerCase();
  
  // Intelligent pattern matching for specific weather types
  if (details.includes('flash flood') || details.includes('flood emergency')) {
    return "Weather Warning - Flash Flood Alert";
  } else if (details.includes('flood') && details.includes('warning')) {
    return "Weather Warning - Flood Alert";
  }
  // ... additional pattern matching for all weather types
};
```
